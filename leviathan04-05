>> ls -lah # shows a hidden directory '.trash'
>> cd .trash; ls -lah # shows a file named 'bin' with setuid set, owned by leviathan5
>> ltrace ./bin # shows fopen("/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan5", "r"), the password for leviathan5 is being read
>> ./bin # outputs ones and zeros, probably the password for the next level in binary text
